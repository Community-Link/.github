## Welcome to Community Link 🌐

Community Link aims to bridge the digital divide by providing internet connectivity through a cooperative model. Our project leverages WiFi mesh networks and 4/5G connectivity to bring reliable internet to rural communities. 
Using smart contracts, we introduce financial inclusion, enabling communities to share internet costs and access global markets.

This project is still early phase and we invite all open source developers to join our journey,
